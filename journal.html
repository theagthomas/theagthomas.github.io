	<h1>Journal Entry 1 (9/21/23):</h1>

	<p>In order to save journal to the internet, you open terminal, open your desktop and folder. Next, I added the font that I liked and checked the status. You do:

	<ol>
	<li> <b> cd ./ desktop/theathomas.github.io to get into your folder. </b> </li>
	<li>
	Then, you add changes <b>git add .</b> </li>
	<li>Then, you <b>git commit -m "your message here"</b></li>

	<li> Then, do <b>git push</b></p>
</li>

</ol>


	<p>The font I used was Averia Serif Libra. Use Berkshire Swash next.</p> 

	<h1>Journal Entry 2 (9/26/23):</h1>

	<p> Today we made the link to our website and I used an image with pink lipstick marks as the background. I'm updating my journal right now. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 3 (10/3/23): </h1>

	<p> I missed last class and what we did was this boxes animation that's also on classes. This class we did an animation on sublime text and made the box move to the left and rotate.

	<h1> Journal Entry 4 (11/9/23): </h1>

	<p> I worked on finalizing my gratitude card/birthday gift for Nola. I had to add the last couple of pictures. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 5 (11/14/23): </h1>

	<p> I pushed Nola's birthday gift/gratitue card to the internet. There are a bunch of divs with pictures of her and text relative and above those pictures. I added the title at the top as well as the instructions. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 6 (11/16/23): </h1>

	<p> I moved on from working on the gratitude gift for Nola and decided to work on something Christmas themed. Even though it's incomplete, I pushed it to the internet. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 7 (11/28/23): </h1>

	<p> I searched up words or terms in CS that I was unsure of. I learned what a parent and child is in HTML and a lot about strings.</p>

	<ol>
	<li> <b> A parent </b>in HTML is the bigger variable that stores the smaller code,<b> the child</b> </li>
	<li>
	A <b>string</b> is a list of characters for a variable. Usually a string is formatted likeThis, where it starts off lowercase and any word after it becomes uppercase.</li>
	<li>The difference between (' ') and (" ") in strings is that<b> single quotes</b> are used to have one factor inside, where <b> double quotes</b> are used to have multiple factors inside.</li>
	<li> You can also <b>combine strings</b>, so if you have two variables you can say... (I have variable1 + "and " + variable2 + ".") This will format as I have variable1 and variable2.</p>
</li>

</ol>

	<h1> Journal Entry 8 (11/30/23): </h1>

	<p> Today we worked on a function that runs the div as many times as you want without having to repeat the code many times. I included 18 volleyball because I played #18 on JV volleyball.</p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 9 (12/14/23): </h1>

	<p> I worked on my face creation animation. I added the divs for the face, eyes, nose, and lips. The click function doesn't entirely work for adding the features, but they're all there on the website. Next class I'm going to add the click function. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 10 (1/9/24): </h1>

	<p> Today we worked on making a generator and randomizing names. I made a variable called people and put in the names of everyone in our class. Next, I made a variable called names, which randomizes what name is shown. I added *5 so that it will only go to the 5th name. In order to put it in my console, I write console.log and put (people[names]) in it. So that through all of the people listed it randomizes which one shows in the console.

	<h1> Journal Entry 11 (1/11/24): </h1>

	<p> We made a slot machine. Mine was themed "Who's going to be a millionare?" and I included the names of everyone in our Computer Science class + Chris Brown. I'm almost done, I just have to add images and fix the handle. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 12 (1/16/24): </h1>

	<p> I made a random choice generator that lists a bunch of volleyball player so that people who visit my website can choose a random volleyball player. It's unfinished for now. I got Harpery Murray on my first choice who I hate, but I got Maddie Skinner on the second try who I love! </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 13 (1/18/24): </h1>

	<p> I made another random choice generator. It's now in-progress. It will eventually be two divs next to each other (both randomizers) where one will show the flag of the country and the one peside it will show a picture(s) of some traditional food from that country. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 14 (1/25/24): </h1>

	<p> I finished my array project aka that randomizer that chooses a random country and displays some traditional food from that country. Jake was hating on my project. He said "It was a pretty bummy project." </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 15 (1/30/24): </h1>

	<p> I've decided to add recipies to my array project aka my choose your food from a country project. I'm clicking the links that the images go to when you click on them online and i'm adding that recipe so that when you click on the flag you can see the recipe. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 16 (2/1/24): </h1>

	<p> In the beginning of class, I finished my array project. All the recipes are now linked to the countries' flags. I began working on the car project. Julia and I have matching pink porsches! I added my pink porsche and then I added variables x and y so it can move around on the axis. Now it can move in all directions.</p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 17 (2/6/24): </h1>

	<p> We began to work on our valentine's day gift/animation. For Valentine's day, I'm making an animation where when you hover of the div, a picture of me with someone will show up. I set up the divs and the tags, but I have to make my hover event Listener, so it's unfinished. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 18 (2/15/24): </h1>

	<p> I worked a little bit and began my "What are you getting on your next text" project. I'm using some components that I worked on in my favorite volleyball player project (by mentioning the random aspect) as well as the valentine's day project (by including similar divs). I worked a little bit on my valentine's day project even though Valentine's day has already passed as well. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 19 (2/22/24): </h1>

	<p> We learned about color and we made a color randomizer in class. I'm planning on actually figuring out a project to go with it. We learned how to change the color on a click function and how to set a range for those colors. We used RGB and made seperate variables for R, G, and B. I just added the project to my projects page. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 20 (2/27/24): </h1>

	<p> Over the weekend, I finished my Valentine's day card. I just added directions to my array project, finishing it. This class we're focusing on finishing our projects up before report writing day. I started working and have to finish working on my face animation, where I add facial features to the div.</p>
