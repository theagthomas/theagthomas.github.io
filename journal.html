	<h1>Journal Entry 1 (9/21/23):</h1>

	<p>In order to save journal to the internet, you open terminal, open your desktop and folder. Next, I added the font that I liked and checked the status. I then did add, commit, push with git in front of each of them and checked the status again.</p>

	<p>The font I used was Averia Serif Libra. Use Berkshire Swash next.</p> 

	<h1>Journal Entry 2 (9/26/23):</h1>

	<p> Today we made the link to our website and I used an image with pink lipstick marks as the background. I'm updating my journal right now, obviously. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 3 (10/3/23): </h1>

	<p> I missed last class and what we did was this boxes animation that's also on classes. This class we did an animation on sublime text and made the box move to the left and rotate.
