	<h1>Journal Entry 1 (9/21/23):</h1>

	<p>In order to save journal to the internet, you open terminal, open your desktop and folder. Next, I added the font that I liked and checked the status. You do:

	<ol>
	<li> <b> cd ./ desktop/theathomas.github.io to get into your folder. </b> </li>
	<li>
	Then, you add changes <b>git add .</b> </li>
	<li>Then, you <b>git commit -m "your message here"</b></li>

	<li> Then, do <b>git push</b></p>
</li>

</ol>


	<p>The font I used was Averia Serif Libra. Use Berkshire Swash next.</p> 

	<h1>Journal Entry 2 (9/26/23):</h1>

	<p> Today we made the link to our website and I used an image with pink lipstick marks as the background. I'm updating my journal right now. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 3 (10/3/23): </h1>

	<p> I missed last class and what we did was this boxes animation that's also on classes. This class we did an animation on sublime text and made the box move to the left and rotate.

	<h1> Journal Entry 4 (11/9/23): </h1>

	<p> I worked on finalizing my gratitude card/birthday gift for Nola. I had to add the last couple of pictures. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 5 (11/14/23): </h1>

	<p> I pushed Nola's birthday gift/gratitue card to the internet. There are a bunch of divs with pictures of her and text relative and above those pictures. I added the title at the top as well as the instructions. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 6 (11/16/23): </h1>

	<p> I moved on from working on the gratitude gift for Nola and decided to work on something Christmas themed. Even though it's incomplete, I pushed it to the internet. </p>

	<h1> Journal Entry 7 (11/28/23): </h1>

	<p> I searched up words or terms in CS that I was unsure of. I learned what a parent and child is in HTML and what a string is. </p>

	<h1>First week of  CS1! :D</h1>
